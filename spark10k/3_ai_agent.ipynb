    "1. **ReAct Pattern**: The agent follows the Reasoning + Acting pattern where it thinks through a problem, takes actions, and responds to observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Management**: The agent maintains the conversation history to provide context for each API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Use**: The agent can use tools (functions) to gather information or perform calculations, extending its capabilities beyond pure language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Orchestration**: The query function handles the back-and-forth between thinking, acting, and observing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Text Parsing**: Regular expressions extract structured information from the model's text outputs.\n",
