    "- `action`: Executes any tool calls the LLM requests\n",

    "1. The LLM is called first with the user's input\n",
    "2. If the LLM wants to use a tool (determined by `exists_action`), we go to the action node\n",
    "3. After executing the tool, we go back to the LLM to interpret the results\n",
    "4. If the LLM doesn't need a tool, we end the flow and return its direct response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "- `exists_action`: Determines if the LLM wants to use a tool\n",
    "- `call_openai`: Calls the LLM with the conversation history\n",
    "- `take_action`: Executes any tool calls and returns the results\n",
